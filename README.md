# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles and machine setup documentation for macOS and Linux. It is divided into three parts.
1. `dotfiles/packages/...` These are the actual package config dotfiles that Stow manages through symlinks
2. `dotfiles/docs/*.md` These are markdown files that provide additional configuration for tools, software, etc. that are developer based and non GUI oriented.
3. Wiki: The [wiki](https://github.com/kshannon/dotfiles/wiki) in this repo provides images and instructions for setting up non devloper centric software, e.g. how I set up my menu bar in mac os, and other ancillary tools.
